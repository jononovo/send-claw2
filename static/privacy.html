    <h1>5Ducks Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: July 24, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to 5Ducks ("we," "our," or "us"). At 5Ducks, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our lead generation platform and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Service.</p>

        <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong>: We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities and to maintain your session while using our Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We Receive From Third Parties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Authentication</strong>: When you sign in with Google, we receive information from Google in accordance with your Google account settings and the permissions you grant us.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Data Sources</strong>: We may collect professional contact information from publicly available sources, business directories, and other legitimate data sources as part of our lead generation services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Providing and Maintaining the Service</strong>: To deliver the features and functionality of our lead generation platform, including searching for companies and contacts, creating lists, and sending emails.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Management</strong>: To create and manage your account, authenticate you, and personalize your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications</strong>: To facilitate your communications with prospects via Gmail, in accordance with your instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Improvement</strong>: To understand how our Service is used, identify areas for improvement, and develop new features.</li>

        <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention</strong>: To detect, prevent, and address fraud, security breaches, and other potentially harmful activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: We may share your information when you direct us to do so or grant us permission, such as when you authorize us to send emails on your behalf via Gmail.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to perform work on our behalf. These service providers include:
            <ul>
                <li>Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity (AI services)</li>
                <li>Hunter.io and Apollo.io (lead generation services)</li>
                <li>AWS (cloud hosting)</li>
                <li>Replit (development environment)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>

        <li><strong>Protection of Rights</strong>: We may disclose your information to protect the rights, property, or safety of 5Ducks, our users, or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI-Powered Email Response Suggestions</h2>
    <p>We do not use data accessed through Google Workspace APIs or Photos APIs for any AI analysis. No AI/ML model interacts directly with data obtained from these APIs. If and when we introduce our optional "Replies" feature, email responses displayed within the app (sent via the user's Gmail integration) may be made available to the user—but AI analysis of that content will only occur if and when the user explicitly requests it. This optional analysis is performed entirely with user consent and control.</p>
    
    <p>5Ducks's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. We use Google API data solely for providing and improving the features you've requested, and we do not use Google API data for serving advertisements or for any purposes unrelated to the core functionality of our email campaign service.</p>

    <h3>Data Separation and Protection</h3>
    <p>We maintain strict separation between data accessed through Google APIs and any AI processing systems. Google API data is used exclusively for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sending emails on your behalf through Gmail</li>
        <li>Retrieving basic profile information for authentication</li>
        <li>Providing core email campaign functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI features, when enabled by users, operate only on data stored within our platform and never directly access or process data from Google APIs.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Portability</strong>: You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and in some cases, receive this information in a structured, commonly used format.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction</strong>: You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: You have the right to request that we delete your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Restriction and Objection</strong>: You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information or to object to our processing of your personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent</strong>: Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@5ducks.ai">privacy@5ducks.ai</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security of your personal information. However, please understand that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.</p>

    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the information to the United States and process it there.</p>
