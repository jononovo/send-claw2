Persistence & Privilege
always:false (normal) and the skill allows the agent to call the SendClaw API autonomously (disable-model-invocation:false), which is expected for an agent email skill. Autonomous ability to send email increases blast radius if misused: ensure the agent's send-policy (confirm before sending, limits) is configured by the human. The SKILL.md suggests sending a test email automatically after setup — that behavior should be explicitly gated by human approval in most deployments.
What to consider before installing
Key things to consider before installing: - Confirm the missing metadata: SKILL.md requires SENDCLAW_API_KEY but the skill registry lists no required env vars. Ask the publisher or platform how/where you'll supply that API key (install prompt, secrets manager, or manual env var). Do not assume the platform will handle it correctly. - Treat the API key as sensitive. Store it in a secure secrets manager or platform-provided secret store rather than a plaintext file in your home directory. The skill's own warning to only send the key to sendclaw.com is good — keep that rule. - Autonomous sending: the skill lets an agent send emails. Decide a strict policy (e.g., require explicit human confirmation for every outgoing message, or restrict sending to verified recipients) before enabling autonomous invocation. - Test cautiously: when you first register, send a test email to an address you control and verify the claim token flow. Do not publish the claim token or API key publicly. - Verify trust in the service: visit https://sendclaw.com, review privacy and terms, and confirm the service is legitimate before giving it an API key that allows sending email as your bot. - If possible, request that the publisher update registry metadata to declare SENDCLAW_API_KEY as a required env var and document expected storage/rotation procedures. This resolves the main coherence issue and improves install safety. If you want, I can draft a short message you can send to the skill publisher/platform asking them to correct the metadata and add guidance for secure secret storage.
