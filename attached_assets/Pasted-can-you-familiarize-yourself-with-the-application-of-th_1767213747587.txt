can you familiarize yourself with the application of the search page and then with the stealth landing page and how it shows different elements sort of one after another in a slideshow sort of?

I have this demo video that I've created as an HTML file so that it's not as big as a actual video file and it's a simulation of the search and the email composer.

I wanted to sit within sort of a place instead of one of the images that were currently showing within the slideshow on the main page.
It's a bit unconventional, but I think it's quite fun.

what do you think about embedding this sort of instead of or an addition to the existing slides in the south landing page?

Don't change anything yet.

Interactive Demo Simulation - Technical Summary
A self-playing animated demo that simulates a B2B lead generation app workflow, designed to be embedded as a "video-like" component on a landing page.
Structure:

Fixed viewport container (520x650px) with overflow: hidden acts as the "video frame"
Inner content includes search UI, company results, and a slide-in compose drawer
Fake cursor (SVG hand pointer) with position: absolute animates between elements
All animations driven by async JavaScript with await/setTimeout for sequencing

Key Animation Phases:

Type search query (character by character)
Show progress bar, then display company results
Interact with results (collapse/expand companies)
Clear search, type new query, change role filter
Second search with new results
Click contact → Compose drawer slides in from right
Type product in input field
Click "Generate Email" → Subject/body populate
Edit email body
Scroll drawer to show Send button, cursor clicks it
Success toast + confetti animation

Core Functions:

moveCursorTo(element) - Animates cursor to element using getBoundingClientRect() relative to viewport
typeText(text) - Types characters with delay
scrollComposerTo(element) - Scrolls drawer with scrollIntoView + extra pixels
showSuccess() - Displays centered toast with confetti

Positioning:

Cursor and toast use position: absolute within viewport
Compose drawer uses position: absolute with transform: translateX() for slide animation
All coordinates calculated relative to viewport container, not browser window
