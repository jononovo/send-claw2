Key Finding: Location Fields Were Added Recently
Evidence from Schema Comparison
OLD Schema (shared/schema.ts.backup):
typescriptexport const contacts = pgTable("contacts", {
  // ...
  location: text("location"),  // Single field for location string
  // NO city, state, country fields
});
NEW Schema (shared/schema.ts):
typescriptexport const contacts = pgTable("contacts", {
  // ...
  location: text("location"),   // Legacy field kept
  city: text("city"),           // NEW - Added
  state: text("state"),         // NEW - Added  
  country: text("country"),     // NEW - Added
});
What This Tells Us

city, state, country fields were added to the contacts table recently - the backup file doesn't have them
The contact search prompts were likely updated at the same time to request these new fields
This is the same pattern as the company discovery issue - location data was added to prompts, potentially diluting results

Evidence from Apollo Integration
The apollo.ts file shows this is Apollo-related:
typescript// Apollo data takes priority, falls back to existing (Perplexity) data
city: person.city || contact.city || null,
state: person.state || contact.state || null,
country: person.country || contact.country || null
The intent was: Get location from Apollo (which provides it reliably), not from Perplexity discovery.
The Problem
When the city, state, country fields were added to the schema, someone also updated the Perplexity contact prompts to request this data - but Perplexity contact discovery shouldn't be responsible for location. That's Apollo's job.

Summary
SourceShould Provide Location?Currently Provides?Perplexity Company Discovery❌ No (you just removed it)❌ NoPerplexity Contact Discovery❌ No (should be removed)✅ Yes (causes dilution)Apollo Email Search✅ Yes✅ Yes
Recommendation
Remove location from contact search prompts (finder.ts) for the same reason you removed it from company discovery. Apollo will populate city, state, country when it finds emails.
