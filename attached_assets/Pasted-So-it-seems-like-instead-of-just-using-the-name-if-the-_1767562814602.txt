So it seems like instead of just using the name if the EI agent who implemented this feature, added the company and the description to the slug for the person. Like this: /p/sebasti-n-villaveces-convergent-energy-chief-legal-and-pe/34501

This is really long and so unnecessary. 
What are your thoughts?

I feel like SEO will not be able to dissect. What is the company and what is the person so it'll actually ruin search inputs

You're absolutely right. That slug is a mess.

Problems with /p/sebasti-n-villaveces-convergent-energy-chief-legal-and-pe/34501
Too long — 70+ characters in the slug alone
Truncated garbage — "chief-legal-and-pe" (cut off "people officer"?)
Accented characters mangled — "sebastián" → "sebasti-n" (broken)
No SEO clarity — Google can't parse what's the name vs company vs role
Ugly URLs — Users won't trust/click this in search results
What Google Sees
Google tries to extract meaning from URL segments. With your current slug:

/p/sebasti-n-villaveces-convergent-energy-chief-legal-and-pe/34501
    └─────────────────── one blob of text ───────────────────┘
It can't tell:

Person name: sebasti-n-villaveces?
Company: convergent-energy?
Role: chief-legal-and-pe?
It's all noise.

Better Approach: Short Slug + ID
Since the ID guarantees uniqueness, the slug only needs to be:

Human-readable
SEO-friendly (contains the name)
Short
Recommended Format
/p/{firstname-lastname}/{id}
Examples:

/p/sebastian-villaveces/34501
/p/john-smith/12847
/p/jane-doe/9283
Why This Works
Aspect	Long Slug	Short Slug
Length	70+ chars	15-25 chars
Readable	❌	✅
SEO keywords	Muddled	Clear (name)
Uniqueness	Overkill (ID handles it)	ID handles it
User trust	Low	High
Company/Role in Page Content, Not URL
The SEO value of company and role should come from:

Page title: Sebastian Villaveces - Chief Legal Officer at Convergent Energy | 5Ducks
Meta description: Contact Sebastian Villaveces, Chief Legal Officer at Convergent Energy. Find verified email and connect.
H1 tag: Sebastian Villaveces
Page content: Role, company (linked), etc.
Not crammed into the URL.

My Recommendation
Change the slug generator to:

typescript
function generateContactSlug(name: string): string {
  return name
    .toLowerCase()
    .normalize('NFD')                    // Handle accents properly
    .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, '')     // Remove accent marks
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')         // Replace non-alphanumeric
    .replace(/-+/g, '-')                 // Collapse dashes
    .replace(/^-|-$/g, '')               // Trim dashes
    .substring(0, 50);                   // Reasonable limit
}
```

**Result:**
```
"Sebastián Villaveces" → "sebastian-villaveces"
```

**Final URL:**
```
/p/sebastian-villaveces/34501
