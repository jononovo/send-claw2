Complete Analysis: Where the Queries Come From
The Query Sources
Based on the codebase, the non-critical API calls are triggered from header components that render on every authenticated page:
MainNav component (client/src/components/main-nav.tsx):
tsx<StreakButton />           // → /api/daily-outreach/streak-stats
<CreditUpgradeDropdown />  // → /api/credits + /api/stripe/subscription-status
```

These components live in the **global header**, so they fire their queries immediately when any authenticated page loads.

### Query Chain on `/app` or `/app/new-search`

| Component | Query | Where Triggered |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `StreakButton` | `/api/daily-outreach/streak-stats` | Header (MainNav) |
| `CreditUpgradeDropdown` | `/api/credits` | Header (MainNav) |
| `CreditUpgradeDropdown` | `/api/stripe/subscription-status` | Header (MainNav) |
| `Home` component | `/api/lists` | Page mount |
| `useAuth` | `/api/user` | Auth context |

### Why This Is a Problem

Even though React Query makes these async, they all fire **simultaneously on mount**:
```
[Mount] → MainNav renders
         ├── StreakButton → fetch('/api/daily-outreach/streak-stats')
         └── CreditUpgradeDropdown → fetch('/api/credits')
                                   → fetch('/api/stripe/subscription-status')
         
[Mount] → Home renders
         └── useEffect → fetch('/api/lists')
         
[Auth] → useAuth
         └── fetch('/api/user')
All 5+ requests compete for bandwidth with the home-D5j6FXnB.js chunk.
Your Proposed Solution is Correct
These header queries should be deferred because:

StreakButton — Shows a flame icon with streak count. User doesn't need this visible in the first 500ms.
CreditUpgradeDropdown — Shows credit balance. Not critical path for search functionality.
Subscription status — Only affects upgrade messaging. Can load lazily.
Lists — Only needed if user clicks the drawer. Could load on drawer open or after idle.

Implementation Approach
For the header components, you could add a deferred loading pattern:
tsx// In StreakButton and CreditUpgradeDropdown
const [canFetch, setCanFetch] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  // Wait for idle time or a short delay
  if ('requestIdleCallback' in window) {
    requestIdleCallback(() => setCanFetch(true));
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => setCanFetch(true), 1000);
  }
}, []);

const { data: stats } = useQuery<StreakStats>({
  queryKey: ['/api/daily-outreach/streak-stats'],
  enabled: !!user && canFetch,  // ← Only fetch after idle
});
